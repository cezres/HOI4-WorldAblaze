Most of the changes are easy to figure out like the focus tree's. But if you are unfamiliar with the mod you can find a few options below that will help clarify some fo the more of the hidden changes to the game. \n\nIf you are interested in getting involved with World Ablaze, ther is currently a discord page were I recommend anyone to post their feedback and suggestions or talk with other players of WA. It also has a beta version with upcoming features that need to be bug tested. Both have links that can be found in the description of the mod\n\nHave fun!"

 afo_event.2.d:0 "Economic laws now give a weekly penalty to war support, to combat this there are more decisions and ministries you invest in. They also gradually provide economy fatigue which reduces construction and repair speed. To counter this, make your war's quick and go to civilian economy after a war.\n\n Economy Fatigue is now located in the Ministries Tab.\n\nThere have been changes made to how economy fatigue affects your nation. Instead of reducing your factory output, it now reduces your civilian factory construction speed. Every 20% of economy fatigue, 5% consumer goods are added to a max of 20% at 80%. You also suffer stability reductions, starting at 1% at 51% economic fatigue and going up to a max of 50% at 100%. At 100% economic you get -10% weekly war support.\n\n"

 afo_event.6.t:0 "Changes to Politics"
 afo_event.6.d:0 "The Ministries Section has been added to the Political Tab.\n\nThe new additions include:\nMinistry of Culture which is focused around women’s place in society. It starts off with more home orientated roles that give you higher stability, but you can change it, at a significant cost or through focuses, to provide more bonuses to your industry and army. For example, higher recruitable population and/or factory output.\n\nMinistry of Defence is focused on war bonds. You use these to reduce your economic fatigue. However, these can only be accessed during war situations and come at the cost of consumer goods for 2 years.\n\nMinistry of Propaganda is focused on providing war support. Since high tier economy laws take weekly war support, this is used to counter that. Each level provides 0.1% weekly war support and takes 0.05 political power per day.\n\nMinistry of Labour is focused on providing miscellaneous buffs such as stability for some consumer goods or a small recruitable population boost for some PP.\n\nMinistry of Business is essentially your economic ideology and it is heavily tied to your political ideology. Fascists can’t fully privatise for example and democracies can’t follow the ideas of national socialism. Each economic ideology provide different buffs and debuffs that range from stability increases/decreases, consumer goods increases/decreases, construction speed, research time, ideology drift defence and so on."
